## Introduction
This is an internal security audit done as a practice to hone my skills and give me experience in doing security audits. This audit is performed on the ficticious company Barium Toys, and was completed as a part of my Cybersecurity Portfolio alongside Google's [Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/google-certificates/cybersecurity-certificate) on Coursera. This is course 2, [Play It Safe: Manage Security Risks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/manage-security-risks?specialization=google-cybersecurity).

The goal of this audit is to find security flaws in Botium Toys' cybersecurity program. This includes their assets (such as employee equipment and devices), their internal network, and their systems. I will be using a controls and compliance checklist to determine best practices that need to be implimented to improve their security posture.

## Scenario
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. They have a single physical location that houses most of the operations besides manufacturing. Recently, Botium Toys' online presence has grown, attracting customers outside of the U.S. such as in the European Union. As a result, their information technology department is under pressure to support their market worldwide.

Their IT department's manager has decided that they should perform an internal IT audit, as she is worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company continues to grow without clear guidelines. She believes that an internal audit will help to secure the company's infastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, vulnerabilities, or threats to assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations for conducting busiuness in the Eurpoean Union and the internally processing and accepting online payments.

The IT manager starts by implementing the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), establishing an audit scope and goals, listing IT assets, and completing a risk assesment, with the goal to provide an overview of risks or fines that the company might experience due to the current state of their security posture.

I will review the IT manager's scope, goals, and risk assesment report and then perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
